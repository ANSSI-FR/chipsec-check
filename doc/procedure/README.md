Test procedure
==============

This document explains (in French) the procedure used for testing hardware
during the 2016-2019 tender process. Each requirement has its specific test
procedure detailed in this document, and a summary table is provided in
appendix B.

The procedure is not used anymore for the 2020-2022 tender process because the
requirements have evolved, but the procedure is still provided for historical
purpose.
